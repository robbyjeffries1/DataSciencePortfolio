# load in packages we'll use
library(tidyverse) # utility functions
library(rpart) # for regression trees
library(randomForest) # for random forests

# read the data and store data in DataFrame titled melbourne_data
melbourne_data <- read_csv('/Users/robbyjeffries/PersonalProjects/HousingPrices/melb_data.csv')

# print a summary of the data in Melbourne data
summary(melbourne_data)

# train a decision tree based on our dataset
fit <- rpart(Price ~ Rooms + Bathroom + Landsize + BuildingArea + YearBuilt  + Lattitude + Longtitude, data = melbourne_data)

# plot our regression tree
plot(fit, uniform=TRUE)
# add text labels & make them 60% as big as they are by defauld
text(fit, cex=0.6)

print("Making predicitons for the following 5 houses:")
print(head(melbourne_data))

print("The predictions are")
print(predict(fit, head(melbourne_data)))

print("Actual price")
print(head(melbourne_data$Price))

## Determining how accurate the model is

# package with the mae function
library(modelr)

# get the mean average error for our model
mae(model = fit, data = melbourne_data)

# split our data so that 30% is in the test set and 70% is in the training set
splitData <- resample_partition(melbourne_data, c(test = 0.3, train = 0.7))

# how many cases are in test & training set?
lapply(splitData, dim)

# fit a new model to our training set
fit2 <- rpart(Price ~ Rooms + Bathroom + Landsize + BuildingArea + YearBuilt + Lattitude + Longtitude, data = splitData$train)

# get the mean average error for our new model, based on our test data
mae(model = fit2, data = splitData$test)

# a function to get the maximum average error for a given max depth. You should pass in
# the target as the name of the target column and the predictors as vector where
# each item in the vector is the name of the column
get_mae <- function(maxdepth, target, predictors, training_data, testing_data){
  
  # turn the predictors & target into a formula to pass to rpart()
  predictors <- paste(predictors, collapse="+")
  formula <- as.formula(paste(target,"~",predictors,sep = ""))
  
  # build our model
  model <- rpart(formula, data = training_data, 
                 control = rpart.control(maxdepth = maxdepth))
  
  # get the mae
  mae <- mae(model, testing_data)
  return(mae)
}

# target & predictors to feed into our formula
target <- "Price"
predictors <- c("Rooms","Bathroom","Landsize","BuildingArea","YearBuilt","Lattitude","Longtitude")

# get the MAE for maxdepths between 1 & 10
for(i in 1:10){
  mae <- get_mae(maxdepth = i, target = target, predictors = predictors,
                 training_data = splitData$train, testing_data = splitData$test)
  print(glue::glue("Maxdepth: ",i,"\t MAE: ",mae))

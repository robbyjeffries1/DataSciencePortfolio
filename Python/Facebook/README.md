# Lifetime Facebook Usage
## Description
One afternoon, I wondered how many posts I had shared on Facebook since creating my profile in summer 2014. I quickly realized this was a task for Python. 

I started by downloading my personal data from Facebook in a JSON format. (For privacy, I stored the JSON files on my personal computer, and I accessed the files with relative paths. Although my Facebook posts are visible to my friends, they are not all public posts. I thought I would keep it that way on Github.) Using Python, I created bar graphs to illustrate the total number of posts and reactions, clustering the counts into monthly intervals.

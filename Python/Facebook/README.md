# Lifetime Facebook Usage
## Description
One afternoon, I wondered how many posts I had shared on Facebook over the past seven years. I created my profile in summer 2014, and I quickly realized this was a task for Python. 

I started by downloading my personal data from Facebook in a JSON format. (For privacy, I stored the JSON files on my personal computer, and I accessed the files with relative paths. Although my Facebook posts are visible to my friends, they are not all public posts. I thought I would keep it that way on Github.) Using Python, I created bar graphs for posts and reactions, clustering the total count into monthly intervals.

* [Facebook Posts](facebook_posts.py): I create a graph that shows how many posts I shared per month that I've had Facebook.

* [Facebook Reactions](facebook_reactions.py):  I create a graph that shows how many likes and comments I initiated per month that I've had Facebook.
